## Exifixer

Updates file creation and modification times to match the EXIF data.

If your filesystem has screwed up the creation or modification times of
your JPEGs, and your applications getting confused with all the wrong
times, run your files and directories through Exifixer.


### Usage

```
exifixer /path/to/file/folder
```

Or just run the included Mac application that allows files/folders to be dropped
on it (thanks to [Platypus](http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus)).
